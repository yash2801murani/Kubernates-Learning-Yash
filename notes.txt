Que....

Supose we have 3 pod working with nginx without labels and now we want Replicaset to manage this pods and ensure keep on 3
can working continuously. 

so can we need to add template pod in Replicaset yaml?? please note we have already running pods with image and all. 

Ans : Yes.... Definately required bcz once pod get failed Replicaset requires pod template to initiate the new pod.

kubectl scale --replicas=6  Replicaset/replicasetname
